If you like these R&D experiments ⚗️, could you offer me a splendid [na' tazzulel e' cafè"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ambrosinus) ☕ (a Neapolitan little cup of espresso coffee) as my favourite fuel ⛽ which I convert into 💡 research, tools 🧰, workflows, video 🎞️, articles 📚... whatever ⚙️ could be helpful for architects and designers in the Digital Era.

*"In Naples, once upon a time, there was a beautiful habit: when a person was excited and had a coffee at the bar, instead of one he paid for two. The second, named "caffè sospeso" (pending coffee) was reserved for the customer who came immediately after. In other words, it was a coffee offered to humanity"*

if you come around Naples ...a "caffè sospeso" always still waiting for you! 😉
