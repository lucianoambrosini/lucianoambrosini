If you like these R&D experiments ⚗️, could you offer me a splendid <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ambrosinus" target="_blank" title="Coffee time???" style="color: auto; font-weight: bold;">"tazzulel e' cafè"</a>☕ (a Neapolitan little cup of espresso coffee) as my favourite fuel ⛽ which I convert into 💡 research, tools 🧰, workflows, video 🎞️, articles 📚... whatever ⚙️ could be helpful for architects and designers in the Digital Era.</h6>

### Hey there 👋,
I am a PhD Architect 🎓📐👷🏻‍♂️, Computational Designer 🛠️ & Environmental Designer 🌦️🌍🌡️. I like coding 👨‍💻 sometimes in C#/Python🐍 or with Grasshopper-vanilla components...a sort of *Computational Alchemyst Architect* 🧙 my maxim is: Customizing the World! 💖. Here you will find a bit about me, my "garage" projects, and how to get in touch 💬.

#### About me
- 🚀 I started my academic journey as an Aerospatial Engineer 🪐👨‍🚀
- 🦗 Computational Designer. I have 9 years of experience as a passionate as self-taught. 
- ⚗️ I am not a native Programmer, but as an Architect navigating the complexities of the "Digital Era", I like “breaking and hacking” the code to better perform/optimise the Architectural project and its design.
- 💎 Sharing coffee time ☕ with people is the best friendship act. It's precious for creativity and sharing knowledge!
- 💖 I love Women ..ehm sorry 🤵 I would say complex things 😚. I'm fascinated by procedural geometry, morphogenesis, digital data design, AI and many other fields of knowledge and creativity.
